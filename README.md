# nerdtree-visual-selection
This plugin requires NERDTree also to be installed. It defines key mappings that will work on files captured by a Visual selection in NERDTree. If possible, those keymappings are defined by NERDTree settings that you define, or their default values, and are as follows:

NERDTree variable | default | Purpose
---|---|---
NERDTreeMapActivateNode | o | Open selected files.
NERDTreeMapOpenSplit    | i | Open selected files in horizontal splits.
NERDTreeMapOpenVSplit   | s | Open selected files in vertical splits.
NERDTreeMapOpenInTab    | t | Open selected files in tabs.
none                    | dd | Delete selected files from disk. If open in Vim, they remain open.
